Claude Code is a powerful CLI tool that allows you to interact with Claude AI models directly from your terminal. This guide will walk you through setting up Claude Code to work with Amazon Bedrock as the backend provider.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with [Bedrock access enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/setting-up.html)
- [Node.js (v14 or later) and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system
- AWS CLI installed and [configured with appropriate permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Access to Anthropic Claude 3.7 in your AWS Bedrock account

## Setup Steps

1. **Install Claude Code CLI**

   Install the official Claude Code CLI tool from Anthropic:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

   You can verify the installation was successful by running:

   ```bash
   claude --version
   ```

   For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [official Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code).

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**

   Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured with permissions for Bedrock:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   You'll need to enter:
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - Default region name (use a region where Claude 3.7 is available, like `us-east-1`)
   - Default output format (recommended: `json`)

   For IAM permissions, your user/role needs:
   - `bedrock:InvokeModel`
   - `bedrock:ListFoundationModels`
   
   For detailed AWS credentials setup, see the [AWS CLI Configuration Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

3. **Enable Claude 3.7 Model Access in Bedrock**

   1. Navigate to the [AWS Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock) in a [supported region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-regions.html) (e.g., `us-east-1`)

   2. Complete Bedrock onboarding if needed (accept terms and conditions)

   3. Go to "Model access" â†’ "Manage model access"

   4. Find "Anthropic" and check "Claude 3.7 Sonnet" (anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0)
   
   5. Click "Request model access" and "Save changes"

   6. Wait a few minutes for access to be granted (status will change from "Pending" to "Access granted")

   You can verify access using the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region us-east-1 | grep anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet
   ```

   If you encounter issues, check that your account has completed [Bedrock onboarding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/setting-up.html#setting-up-manage-access) and review [service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html) in your selected region.

4. **Set Environment Variables**

   To tell Claude Code to use Bedrock as its backend, you need to set some environment variables. These are special settings that tell the software which model to use and where to find it.

   ### Quick Start (Temporary Use)

   If you just want to try Claude Code with Bedrock quickly, you can run these commands in your terminal before using Claude:

   ```bash
   # Copy and paste these lines into your terminal
   export DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1 
   export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0'
   export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
   ```

   After running these commands in your terminal window, you can immediately use Claude Code with Bedrock by running `claude` commands in that same terminal window. However, these settings will only last until you close that terminal window.

   ### For US East Region (Virginia)
   
   If you're using the US East region (which is the default for many AWS accounts):

   ```bash
   export AWS_REGION='us-east-1'
   ```

   ### For Permanent Configuration

   To avoid having to set these variables every time, you can make them permanent by adding them to your shell's configuration file:

   1. Open your shell configuration file in a text editor:
      - For Mac/Linux with Bash: `nano ~/.bashrc` or `nano ~/.bash_profile`
      - For Mac with Zsh: `nano ~/.zshrc`
      - For Fish shell: `nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish`

   2. Add these lines at the end of the file:
      ```bash
      # Claude Code Bedrock configuration
      export DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1 
      export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0'
      export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
      export AWS_REGION='us-east-1'  # Change this if using a different region
      ```

   3. Save the file and exit the editor
      - In nano: Press `Ctrl+O` to save, then `Enter`, then `Ctrl+X` to exit

   4. Apply the changes by reloading your configuration:
      ```bash
      # For bash (choose one depending on which file you edited)
      source ~/.bashrc
      # OR
      source ~/.bash_profile
      
      # For zsh
      source ~/.zshrc
      
      # For fish
      source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
      ```

   After completing these steps, Claude Code will use Bedrock in all your terminal sessions.

## Using Claude Code with Bedrock

Claude Code has access to the directory where it's executed, allowing it to analyze your project files, understand your codebase, and assist with development tasks. It can guide you through complex processes by suggesting next steps and requesting permission before running commands that modify your files or system.

This means you can use Claude to help build entire projects, solve complex coding challenges, or fix bugs by giving it context about your codebase. Claude will analyze the relevant files and provide step-by-step assistance, asking for confirmation before taking actions that might alter your system or files.

Once configured, you can start using Claude Code with commands like:

```bash
# Ask Claude a question
claude "How do I optimize Docker images?"

# Run Claude in interactive mode
claude

# Run Claude with context from a specific file
claude --context path/to/file.py "Explain this code"

# Use Claude to help debug an error message
claude --context error_log.txt "How do I fix this error?"

# Generate code based on requirements
claude "Write a Python script that reads CSV files and outputs JSON"

# Review and explain complex code
claude --context complex_module.js "Explain how this module works"

# Analyze logs or data
claude --context application.log "Summarize these logs and identify issues"

# Help with Git operations
claude "How do I rebase my feature branch onto main and resolve conflicts?"

# Multiple contexts for more comprehensive analysis
claude --context file1.js --context file2.js "How do these two files interact?"

# Use Claude for infrastructure as code help
claude --context terraform.tf "Optimize this Terraform configuration"
```

## Benefits of Using Bedrock Backend

- Data privacy - your queries stay within your AWS environment
- Cost management through AWS billing
- Access control through IAM policies
- Lower latency (depending on region configuration)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Claude Code using Bedrock, try these troubleshooting steps:

### Connection and Authentication Issues

1. **Verify AWS Credentials and Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Check if your credentials are properly configured
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   
   # Verify you have Bedrock access
   aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region us-east-1
   ```

2. **Confirm Model Access**
   ```bash
   # Check if Claude 3.7 is available to your account
   aws bedrock list-foundation-models --query "modelSummaries[?modelId=='anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0']" --region us-east-1
   ```

3. **Region Configuration**
   - Ensure your `AWS_REGION` environment variable (or default region) is set to a region where Claude 3.7 is available
   - Verify model availability in your region in the [Bedrock service endpoints documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/endpoints-service.html)

### Common Error Messages

- **"AccessDeniedException"** - Check IAM permissions; your user/role needs `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission
- **"ValidationException: Model not found"** - Verify model ID and region compatibility
- **"ResourceNotFoundException"** - Ensure you've completed model access approval
- **"ThrottlingException"** or **"429 Too many tokens, please wait before trying again."** - You may have exceeded your quota or rate limit. When this happens, the Claude CLI will display a message saying "429 Too many tokens, please wait before trying again." This is because AWS Bedrock enforces rate limits on API requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation across all users.

  **What's happening:** AWS Bedrock has token rate limits that restrict how many tokens you can process within a specific timeframe (usually per minute). When you exceed this limit, AWS returns a 429 error code (Too Many Requests), which Claude CLI then displays as a user-friendly message.
  
  **How to fix it:**
  - Wait a few minutes before trying again to allow your token quota to refresh
  - For production applications, implement exponential backoff and retry logic
  - If you consistently hit limits, request a [quota increase through the AWS Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/)
  - Check your [Bedrock quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html) to understand your current limits

### Environment Debugging

Run Claude Code with debug logging enabled:

```bash
DEBUG=* claude "Your prompt here"
```

For persistent issues, you can check AWS CloudTrail logs to see if your Bedrock API calls are being made and any errors they're returning:

```bash
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=InvokeModel
```
