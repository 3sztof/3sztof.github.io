# Using Claude Code with Bedrock Backend

> *Note: This entire blog post, including the thumbnail image, was generated using Claude Code CLI.*

Claude Code is a powerful CLI tool that allows you to interact with Claude AI models directly from your terminal. This guide will walk you through setting up Claude Code to work with Amazon Bedrock as the backend provider.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with Bedrock access
- Claude Code CLI installed
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions

## Setup Steps

1. **Install Claude Code CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

2. **Configure AWS credentials**

   Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

   2.5. **For AWS employees using Isengard**

   If you're an Amazon/AWS employee using Isengard accounts, you can set your credentials with:

   ```bash
   isengardcli assume
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**

   Configure the following environment variables for optimal Bedrock integration:

   ```bash
   # Claude CLI
   export DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1 
   export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0'
   export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
   ```

   For persistent use, add these exports to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish` depending on your shell).

## Using Claude Code with Bedrock

Claude Code has access to the directory where it's executed, allowing it to analyze your project files, understand your codebase, and assist with development tasks. It can guide you through complex processes by suggesting next steps and requesting permission before running commands that modify your files or system.

This means you can use Claude to help build entire projects, solve complex coding challenges, or fix bugs by giving it context about your codebase. Claude will analyze the relevant files and provide step-by-step assistance, asking for confirmation before taking actions that might alter your system or files.

Once configured, you can start using Claude Code with commands like:

```bash
# Ask Claude a question
claude "How do I optimize Docker images?"

# Run Claude in interactive mode
claude

# Run Claude with context from a specific file
claude --context path/to/file.py "Explain this code"

# Use Claude to help debug an error message
claude --context error_log.txt "How do I fix this error?"

# Generate code based on requirements
claude "Write a Python script that reads CSV files and outputs JSON"

# Review and explain complex code
claude --context complex_module.js "Explain how this module works"

# Analyze logs or data
claude --context application.log "Summarize these logs and identify issues"

# Help with Git operations
claude "How do I rebase my feature branch onto main and resolve conflicts?"

# Multiple contexts for more comprehensive analysis
claude --context file1.js --context file2.js "How do these two files interact?"

# Use Claude for infrastructure as code help
claude --context terraform.tf "Optimize this Terraform configuration"
```

## Benefits of Using Bedrock Backend

- Data privacy - your queries stay within your AWS environment
- Cost management through AWS billing
- Access control through IAM policies
- Lower latency (depending on region configuration)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, verify:

1. Your AWS credentials have Bedrock access permissions
2. The Claude model you selected is enabled in your Bedrock account
3. Your AWS region is configured correctly

For more information, check the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/claude-code) or the [AWS Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

## Meta: How This Post Was Created

This entire blog post, including the featured image, was created using Claude Code CLI in interactive mode. Here's the process:

1. The initial content was generated through a conversation with Claude Code, initiated with the prompt "let's add a blog entry describing how to use claude code with bedrock backend"

2. All modifications, refinements, and additions to the content were made solely through prompts to Claude Code - the author never directly edited any files

3. The featured image was created entirely through Claude Code:
   - Claude suggested ImageMagick commands to generate the base image
   - It created a gradient background, added text elements, AWS Bedrock logo, and symbolic graphics
   - Claude handled image resizing and optimization for web display
   - All image manipulations were performed through commands suggested by Claude and executed with user permission

This workflow demonstrates the power of Claude Code as a complete content creation assistant. The author provided only directional input through conversation, while Claude handled all file creation, editing, and image processing tasks. This showcases the practical application of AI-assisted content creation using Claude Code with the AWS Bedrock backend for production-ready output.
