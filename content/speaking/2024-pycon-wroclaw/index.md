## Presentation

- **Topic**: Building Python CLIs in 2024 does not have to be painful (feat. Typer and uv)
- **Language**: English
- **Co-presenter**: Mateusz Zaremba (Application Architect @ Ørsted)

In our "Dynamic Duo" presentation with Mateusz Zaremba, we focused on sharing best practices for building and delivering intuitive and reliable command line interface applications in Python. We demonstrated how modern tools like Typer and uv can significantly improve the developer experience when creating CLI applications.

Our talk covered:
- Common pain points in traditional CLI development with Python
- How Typer simplifies command creation with type annotations
- Using uv for faster dependency management and packaging
- Best practices for user-friendly CLI design
- Live demonstrations of building a CLI from scratch
- Packaging and distribution strategies for Python CLI tools

We encouraged developers to try these amazing, open-source tools that make CLI development more enjoyable and productive in 2024 and beyond.

## Demo Project

As part of our presentation, we built a fun demo project called "memer-cli" - a command line tool for generating memes. This project demonstrates the concepts we discussed in a practical, engaging way.

**GitHub Repository**: [github.com/zaremb/memer-cli](https://github.com/zaremb/memer-cli)

The repository includes all the code we demonstrated during our talk and serves as a reference implementation for anyone looking to build their own Python CLI tools using Typer and uv.

PyCon Wrocław 2024 was the inaugural edition of this conference, bringing together Python enthusiasts from across Europe. The event featured exceptional speakers including Łukasz Langa (CPython Developer in Residence) and Antonio Cuni (Principal Software Engineer at Anaconda).

The conference was organized by a dedicated team including Maria Linnikova, Anton Cáceres, Vadim Linnikov, and Artur Smęt, along with many amazing volunteers who made this outstanding event possible.

The venue, Concordia Design Wrocław, provided a beautiful setting with a magical atmosphere as the holiday season approached. The conference offered a perfect blend of technical content, networking opportunities, and community spirit.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to have been part of this first-ever PyCon Wrocław and to contribute to the vibrant Python community in Poland. Looking forward to seeing how this conference grows in the coming years!
