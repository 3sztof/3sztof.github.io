## Personal Note

I had the privilege of hosting the "Learn to Code on Amazon Web Services (AWS)" workshop, and it was truly an honor to support such a motivated and talented group of ~40 attendees. 👩‍💻 
The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with approximately 75% of participants rating the workshop's quality as "far above average" in our satisfaction survey. To all the attendees: I'm immensely grateful for your enthusiasm and engagement, you are AWSome! Thank you for inspiring us to develop the workshop further based on your feedback!

I was particularly impressed by the passion displayed by the student participants. Out of the ~11,200 attendees, ~4,500 were students who received grants to attend. It fills me with hope for a more diverse and inclusive future in the tech sector! 👩‍💻👩‍🔬👨‍💻

Talking about empowerment, congratulations to my incredible coworkers: Emilia Smolko, Marta Milejska, Anna Jabłońska, Sandra Cervantes, Magdalena Rempuszewska & Małgorzata Zielińska for being recognized among the "Top 100 Women in Cloud Computing" during the Summit. It's truly inspiring to work alongside such exceptional professionals! 🌟

Lastly, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to Tala Qraitem, Shubhangi Mali, and Mateusz Kępka for their invaluable support during the workshop. Special thanks to Charles Roberts for building it from scratch. And of course, a big shoutout to all the inspiring and talented individuals I had the pleasure of meeting at the summit.

It was a true pleasure connecting with each and every one of you.
