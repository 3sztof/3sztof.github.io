## Presentation

- **Topic**: Async Python: Concurrency Without the Headaches
- **Language**: English
- **Co-presenter**: Mateusz Zaremba (Application Architect @ Orsted)

Returning to PyCon Wroclaw with Mateusz for the second year running! This time we tackled asynchronous programming in Python - a topic that's become essential for building high-performance applications, yet still feels intimidating for many developers.

Our talk provided a hands-on introduction to async programming, explaining how concurrency really works under the hood. We covered:

- Key async concepts: `async`, `await`, and the event loop
- Common patterns like `asyncio.gather` and task coordination
- Real-world use cases: concurrent API calls and async database operations
- A live debugging session diving into a classic async pitfall
- Introduction to [Asyncer](https://github.com/tiangolo/asyncer), a modern library that simplifies async workflows

For a deeper dive into the concepts we covered, check out my [comprehensive guide to async Python concurrency](/posts/async-python-concurrency/).

## Event

- **Date**: June 14, 2025
- **Location**: Concordia Design Wroclaw, Wyspa Slodowa 7, Wroclaw, Poland

## More

PyCon Wroclaw continues to grow as one of the premier Python events in Poland. The organizers - Maria Linnikova, Anton Caceres, Vadim Linnikov, Artur Smet, and the entire volunteer team - have built something special here. The conference maintains that perfect balance of high-quality technical content and genuine community warmth.

It was fantastic to see so many familiar faces from last year's inaugural edition, along with plenty of new attendees discovering the conference for the first time. The questions and discussions after our talk showed just how much interest there is in understanding async Python properly rather than just cargo-culting patterns.

Being invited back to speak at a conference is always a meaningful endorsement, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to share knowledge with this community again. If you're interested in Python conferences in Poland, PyCon Wroclaw should definitely be on your list.

For those who attended - what async challenges are you facing in your projects? I'd love to hear about real-world use cases where these patterns helped (or where you're still struggling).
