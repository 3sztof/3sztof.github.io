## Mentoring

I have coached and helped the HackYeah hackathon teams in Bosch Rexroth's software/hardware/ai challenge focused on implementing position feedback for EFC (frequency converter) driven motion axis based on visual information from a camera (image recognition, axis position tracking).

Areas of responsibility:
- preparation of the challenge
- software and development environments for hackathon participants
- 24h (x2) support during the hackathon
- Python / JavaScript / NodeJS / NodeRED / Open Core Engineering mentoring for the teams

Tech stack: Python, JavaScript, Bosch Rexroth Open Core Engineering
