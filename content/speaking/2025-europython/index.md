## Presentation

- **Topic**: Async Python: Concurrency Without the Headaches
- **Language**: English

I'll be presenting on asynchronous programming in Python at EuroPython 2025 in Prague. My session will demystify core async concepts like `async`, `await`, and the event loop, making them accessible to developers at all levels. The talk will cover the `asyncio` ecosystem, common patterns like `asyncio.gather` and task coordination, and demonstrate practical implementations for concurrent API calls and database operations. I'll also introduce **Asyncer**, a modern library that simplifies async workflows for developers looking to enhance their async skills.

The presentation will include:
- Clear explanations of why and when to use async in Python
- Visual comparisons of synchronous vs. asynchronous workflows
- Live coding examples of common async patterns
- Real-world use cases for web applications, database queries, and task scheduling
- Tips on integrating sync and async code without blocking the event loop

- **Date**: July 14-20, 2025
- **Location**: Prague Congress Centre, Prague, Czech Republic
