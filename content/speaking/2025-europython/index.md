## Presentation

- **Topic**: Async Python: Concurrency Without the Headaches
- **Language**: English
- **Date**: July 17, 2025
- **Co-presenter**: Mateusz Zaremba, Application Architect at Ørsted

I presented on asynchronous programming in Python at EuroPython 2025 in Prague alongside my colleague Mateusz Zaremba. Our session demystified core async concepts like `async`, `await`, and the event loop, making them accessible to developers at all levels. The talk covered the `asyncio` ecosystem, common patterns like `asyncio.gather` and task coordination, and demonstrated practical implementations for concurrent API calls and database operations. We also introduced **Asyncer**, a modern library that simplifies async workflows for developers looking to enhance their async skills.

The presentation included:
- Clear explanations of why and when to use async in Python
- Visual comparisons of synchronous vs. asynchronous workflows
- Live coding examples of common async patterns
- Real-world use cases for web applications, database queries, and task scheduling
- Tips on integrating sync and async code without blocking the event loop
