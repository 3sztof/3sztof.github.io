## Presentation

- **Topic**: Async Python: Concurrency Without the Headaches
- **Language**: English

I'll be presenting on asynchronous programming in Python at the 16th edition of Warsaw IT Days (Warszawskie Dni Informatyki). My session will break down core async concepts like `async`, `await`, and the event loop in a clear, approachable way, showcasing practical examples and real-world use cases. The talk will cover the `asyncio` ecosystem, common patterns like `asyncio.gather` and task coordination, and demonstrate how to implement async for concurrent API calls and database operations. I'll also introduce **Asyncer**, a modern library that simplifies async workflows for developers ready to take their skills to the next level.
