## Presentation

- **Topic**: SecOps on AWS: Large Scale Cloud Threat Prevention, Detection and Auto-Remediation
- **Language**: English

This session introduced listeners to the concept of SecOps (DevSecOps) and addressed the scale of cloud threat detection and prevention that requires proper automation. I discussed the most important AWS security automation solutions and shared a customer success story from a large polymer manufacturing business that had been targeted by state-sponsored hackers attempting to steal their technology â€” a real project that I have delivered as a part of AWS Professional Services. The presentation demonstrated how automated security solutions can effectively protect cloud environments against sophisticated, large scale threats.
